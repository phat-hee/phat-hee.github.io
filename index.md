# Welcome üëã
I'm **Mohammad Fathi**, a **Master's graduate in Data Mining** from **Kharazmi University** (GPA: 3.74/4.0).  
My research bridges **Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, and Computational Neuroscience**, with a focus on **neuroimaging analysis** and **brain‚Äìcomputer interfaces (BCI)**.

I completed my master's degree **ranked 2nd** in my program, conducting my thesis research at the **Kharazmi Cognitive and Brain Science Lab** under the supervision of **Dr. Mir Mohsen Pedram**. I developed a **temporal graph neural network (TGNN)** framework to classify **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)** and **healthy controls (HC)** using **fNIRS** resting-state data, earning a perfect thesis grade of **20/20**.

## üî¨ Projects

### üß† fNIRS-based MCI Classification
Designed and implemented a **temporal graph neural network (GConvGRU)** to classify **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)** and **Healthy Controls (HC)** from resting-state fNIRS data.  
[üîó GitHub Repository](https://github.com/phat-hee/mci_fnirs_tgnn)  
I performed **all preprocessing and modeling steps** except for data acquisition.  
- Applied a **15-second sliding window** to segment preprocessed fNIRS signals.  
- Constructed temporal graphs representing functional connectivity dynamics.  
- Implemented and trained the **TGNN** architecture using PyTorch Geometric.  
- Evaluated model interpretability using graph-based feature importance analysis.  
This project formed the core of my **Master‚Äôs thesis**, earning a perfect grade (20/20).

### ‚ö° EEG Temporal Graph Neural Network for AD and FTD  
[üîó GitHub Repository](https://github.com/phat-hee/eeg__temporalgraph_ad_ftd_hc)  
Developed a **temporal graph neural network** framework to distinguish **Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (AD)**, **Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)**, and **Healthy Controls (HC)** from resting-state EEG data.  
I proposed the modeling strategy, designed and implemented the entire pipeline, and guided the team‚Äôs methodological choices.  
- Processed the pre-cleaned EEG data and generated **temporal functional connectivity graphs** using **Granger causality** (instead of purely correlation-based methods) for **better interpretability**.  
- Explored multiple network architectures and finalized a **GraphSAGE + LSTM** hybrid model with **attention-based fusion**.  
- Combined information from **alpha** and **beta** frequency bands, as they showed the strongest discriminative power.  
- Analyzed results both for the **whole brain** and **separated lobes** to identify which regions were most relevant for each impairment type.  
This work builds directly on my thesis and extends it from fNIRS to EEG data.

### üß© ABIDE fMRI Graph Analysis
Automated **temporal graph generation** and **sliding-window functional connectivity modeling** using graph neural networks with explainability.  
We employed **causality-based graph construction** to build dynamic brain graphs from resting-state fMRI data and used **Captum** to identify key nodes and features contributing to classification performance.

### üíß Water Network Anomaly Detection
Developed deep learning models for **predictive maintenance** and **leakage detection** in water distribution networks using time-series sensor data.  
Implemented anomaly detection pipelines combining LSTM autoencoders and graph-based representations to capture spatial relationships among nodes.
