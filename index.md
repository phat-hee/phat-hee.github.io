# Welcome 👋
I'm **Mohammad Fathi**, a **Master's graduate in Data Mining** from **Kharazmi University** (GPA: 3.74/4.0, **ranked 2nd** in my program).  
My research bridges **Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, and Computational Neuroscience**, with a focus on **neuroimaging analysis** and **brain–computer interfaces (BCI)**.

I completed my master's thesis research at the **Kharazmi Cognitive and Brain Science Lab** under the supervision of **Dr. Mir Mohsen Pedram**, where I developed a **temporal graph neural network (TGNN)** framework to classify **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)** and **healthy controls (HC)** using **fNIRS** resting-state data.

Currently, I work as a **Data Scientist** at **Atitarh System Saman**, developing machine learning models for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance in water distribution networks.

## 🔬 Projects
- **fNIRS-based MCI Classification:** Designed a temporal graph neural network (GConvGRU) for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment using resting-state fNIRS data.  
- **EEG Deep Learning Pipeline:** Developed a multi-band attention fusion model combining GraphSAGE and LSTM networks for EEG-based brain decoding.  
- **ABIDE fMRI Graph Analysis:** Automated temporal graph generation and sliding-window functional connectivity modeling using graph neural networks with explainability.  
- **Water Network Anomaly Detection:** Built deep learning models for predictive maintenance and leakage detection in water distribution networks.
