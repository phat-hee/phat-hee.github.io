# Welcome 👋

I'm **Mohammad Fathi**, a **Master’s graduate in Data Mining** from **Kharazmi University** (GPA: 3.74/4.0).  
My research bridges **Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, and Computational Neuroscience**, with a focus on **neuroimaging analysis**, **brain–computer interfaces (BCI)**, and **graph-based deep learning**.

I conducted my thesis research at the **Kharazmi Cognitive and Brain Science Lab** under the supervision of **Dr. Mir Mohsen Pedram**, where I developed a **temporal graph neural network (TGNN)** framework to classify **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)** and **healthy controls (HC)** using **fNIRS** resting-state data.

## 🔬 Projects

- **fNIRS-based MCI Classification:** Designed a temporal graph neural network (GConvGRU) for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment using resting-state fNIRS data.  
- **EEG Deep Learning Pipeline:** Developed a multi-band attention fusion model combining GraphSAGE and LSTM networks for EEG-based brain decoding.  
- **ABIDE fMRI Graph Analysis:** Automated temporal graph generation and sliding-window functional connectivity modeling using graph neural networks with explainability.  
- **Water Network Anomaly Detection:** Built deep learning models for predictive maintenance and leakage detection in water distribution networks.
